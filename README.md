# 📢 Advertisement Click Prediction - Mini Project
👋 Hello folks! Welcome to this exciting mini-project on Advertisement Click Prediction!

## 📝 Project Overview
In this project, we work with a real-world dataset focused on online advertisement engagement. The dataset contains detailed user attributes including:

Daily Time Spent on Site

Age

Area Income

Internet Usage

Ad Topic Line

City

Gender

Country

Timestamp of Interaction

The target variable is "Clicked on Ad", which indicates whether a user clicked on the advertisement or not.

Our aim is to build a complete machine learning pipeline—from data exploration and preprocessing to model development and performance evaluation—to classify whether a user is likely to click on an online ad.

## 🎯 Objective
The main goal is to develop and evaluate several machine learning models to predict ad click behavior (Clicked on Ad).

This classification task is valuable for:

Optimizing marketing spend

Enhancing ad targeting strategies

Boosting click-through and conversion rates

Understanding user behavior in digital campaigns

Models Evaluated:
Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Decision Tree

Random Forest

AdaBoost

XGBoost

Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
We assess the performance of each model using the following metrics:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

These metrics help us understand how well each model distinguishes between users who click on ads and those who don’t.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
This project is built in Python using the following libraries:

pandas – Data manipulation

numpy – Numerical operations

matplotlib & seaborn – Visualization

scikit-learn – Machine learning models and evaluation tools

xgboost – Gradient boosting classifier

tensorflow / keras – To build and train the ANN model

## ✅ Outcome
By comparing the models across multiple evaluation metrics, we identify the most effective classifier for advertisement click prediction.

Key takeaways include:

Better understanding of user engagement patterns

Improved digital marketing effectiveness

Data-driven ad targeting strategies

Higher ROI for online advertising platforms

💡 Thanks for checking out this project! We hope it provides practical insights into how machine learning can power smarter marketing decisions.
